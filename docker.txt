Docker images  --- Images are templates used to create docker containers.
For each image in docker hub , there are tags available. Each tag refers to specific version.
For example , -latest is used for latest version of the image 
say -18.14 is to get 18.14 version of that image. 

Images typically contains a union of layered filesystems stacked on top of each other.

Container  -- is a running instance of an image .

Images can be stored at local or remote locations. 
Images are stored in a registry for ex. docker hub , docker hub is a registry where various images are stored.
When firing the run command for an image , you can also give a name to the container using --name ooption .

docker run --name MyUbuntu -it ubuntu:18.1
-it is used to run the container in interactive mode.

Once a container is created using run command ,it will start automatically.
You can start , stop , pause or unpause containers using the container id or name.
docker start MyUbuntu

docker stop MyUbuntu

docker pause MyUbuntu  --> container will stop accepting any commands.

docker unpause MyUbuntu --> container will resume to accept commands.
